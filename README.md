# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I currently work at [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) building the only AI-native vector database in the world
* My software background is mainly in infrastructure but I'm trying to acquire more breadth (what the hell is a Typescript, anyway?)
* I also play a few different instruments, hike a lot (PCT class of 2022 ðŸŒ±), lift weights, read, and listen to techno
* You can reach me by emailing ben (at) beneggers (dot) com
