### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben.

I currently work at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), making banking âœ¨seamless and magicalâœ¨ for companies. I previously worked on Reliability at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and was an SRE at [Google](https://www.google.com/).

My software background is mainly in infrastructure but I'm trying to acquire more breadth and general skills. What the hell is a Typescript, anyway?

Outside of software, I play a few different instruments, hike a lot (PCT class of 2022), lift weights, and read.
