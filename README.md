# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben.

* I currently work at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), making banking âœ¨seamless and magicalâœ¨ for companies
* My software background is mainly in infrastructure but I'm trying to acquire more breadth (what the hell is a Typescript, anyway?)
* I also play a few different instruments, hike a lot (PCT class of 2022 ðŸŒ±), lift weights, read, and listen to techno
